# get5-practicemode-swap
A SourcePawn plugin used for quickly switching between <a href="https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode">PracticeMode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/splewis/get5">Get5</a>

# Commands
Server admins can type ``sm_rcon get5`` or ``sm_rcon practicemode`` in their console to activate the respective plugins.
Alternatively, just enter ``get5`` or ``practicemode`` in the server console to achieve the same effect.

# Installation
Installation is identical to normal plugin installation.
Grab the ``.smx`` file from the <a href ="https://github.com/Ferexx/get5-practicemode-swap/releases/tag/v1.0.0">releases page</a>.
Place the file in the ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` folder of your server's CS:GO installation, then restart the server.
