# get5-practicemode-swap
A SourcePawn plugin used for quickly switching between <a href="https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode">PracticeMode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/splewis/get5">Get5</a>

# Commands
Server admins can type ``!useget5`` in chat or ``sm_rcon useget5`` in their console to activate Get5.
Similarly, ``!usepracticemod`` or ``sm_rcon usepracticemode`` will activate PracticeMode.

Alternatively, ``useget5`` and ``usepracticemode`` in your server provider's web console should work also.

# Installation
Installation is identical to normal plugin installation.
Grab the ``.smx`` file from the <a href ="https://github.com/Ferexx/get5-practicemode-swap/releases">releases page</a>.
Place the file in the ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` folder of your server's CS:GO installation, then restart the server.
